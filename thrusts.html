                        <h3>Low carbon and sustainable materials</h3>
                        <p>The construction industry's significant carbon footprint demands innovative approaches to material development and waste reduction. Our research focuses on creating innovative construction materials from waste streams to reduce carbon emissions in construction, with particular emphasis on decarbonizing infrastructure using novel low-carbon construction materials. We investigate sustainable alternatives to traditional construction materials, including the development of recycled concrete aggregates and waste-to-material conversion processes. Our laboratory experiments have demonstrated that incorporating even small percentages of recycled concrete aggregate can enhance the compressive strength of concrete compared to traditional mixes, highlighting the dual benefits of sustainability and performance enhancement. This research thrust addresses the critical need for environmentally responsible construction practices while maintaining structural integrity and performance standards.</p>

                        <h3>Corrosion</h3>
                        <p>Our corrosion research addresses one of the most significant challenges in concrete infrastructure durability and longevity. We investigate various corrosion mechanisms affecting concrete structures, with particular focus on understanding the complex interactions between environmental factors and material degradation. Our work encompasses both the fundamental science of corrosion processes and the development of mitigation strategies to extend infrastructure lifespan. This includes studying microbial-induced concrete corrosion, chloride ingress, and other deterioration mechanisms that compromise structural integrity. Through comprehensive analysis of corrosion phenomena, we aim to develop predictive models and protective measures that enhance the resilience of concrete infrastructure in challenging environments.</p>

                        <h3>Advanced technology for innovative construction</h3>
                        <p>Our advanced technology research centers on developing cutting-edge construction materials and systems, focusing on their intrinsic relationship to structural systems and environmental performance. We explore smart and resilient building materials that integrate advanced technologies to improve performance, monitoring capabilities, and adaptive responses to environmental conditions. This thrust encompasses the development of self-sensing materials, smart concrete systems, and innovative material characterization techniques. Our work contributes to sustainable and smart-resilient buildings and civil infrastructure, addressing the growing need for intelligent construction materials that can monitor their own condition and adapt to changing environmental demands. By leveraging emerging technologies, we aim to create next-generation construction materials that offer enhanced functionality beyond traditional structural requirements.</p>
